# Word-Guessing-Game-apk
An android app apk in which you are given a random word (200 possible) and you must guess each letter to form the word. You may also guess the entire word.
This was my first attempt at creating an android app using android studio and was purely for my learning of various widgets, animating pictures/text, and brushing up on some java.

DISCLAIMER: Tested only on Pixel 2 emulator and a Galaxy S8, screen sizes may affect design.
